Welcome! This is an **Unofficial/Fan made** project about the magical girls JRPG franchise **Blue Reflection**.

## Content

The project contains both **Resource Pack** and **Data Pack** with the most well-known NPC enemies of the franchise, allowing players to visualize them in-game.

The content of each pack is written below:

### Resource Pack (visuals)

3D models and textures of the main demons of the franchise.

Pack's features:
- 3D Models in JSON files
- Textures in PNG files
- Overrides for a default Minecraft item (Nether Brick) to render the custom models

### Data Pack (behaviours)

Functions that just allow render every demon into the game and make them walk around the world. 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the data pack's purpose is to be used as a **template** for other players or developers to be edited to their needs.

Pack's features:
- Natural random spawning (replaces all hostile ground mobs)
- Constant synchronization between the base mob (Vindicator) and its armor stand (3D model)
- Death detection system (clears 3D model rendering)
- Mobs custom names (always invisible)
- Mobs deal a minimum amount of damage to players

## Demons List
