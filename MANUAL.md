# Blue Reflection Minecraft Demons - Manual

## Downloading Project

1. From this repository webpage, go to the **Releases** section.
2. Select the release of your preference and look for its **Assets** section.
3. Download the file **Blue_Reflection_Demons_Java_1.`Minecraft Release`_v.1.`Pack Version`.zip** according to the version of the game you're going to play.

Once you downloaded the corresponding ZIP file, then unzip it and you should see the following content:

Where the **datapack** subfolder contains the Data Pack you're going to install, and the **resourcepack** subfolder contains the Resource Pack you're going to load.

> [!WARNING]
> Both Data and Resource packs are available **only for Minecraft main releases**, since **v.1.14** and above. So if you try to play in minor releases (like 1.19.3, 1.16.2, etc.) they could cause troubles.

## Loading the Resource Pack

Once you downloaded and unzipped the file, first you should install the Resource Pack folder. To load this (and any) resource pack into Minecraft, you should follow the instructions described in this Minecraft Wiki article: [Loading a resource pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack)

If you loaded it correctly, you might see it on the **Selected** section. Like this:

## Installing the Data Pack

After loading the Resource Pack, then to install the data pack (and any one) into your Minecraft world, you should follow the instructions described in this Minecraft Wiki article: [Installing a data pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack)

## Reloading the Data Pack

Inside the game, if your world is allowed to use cheats (commands), then open the chat bar and type the `/reload` command to restart every data pack installed in your world's folder. You'll see a message like this one:
